This repository contains an analysis for the impact COVID has had on the housing market.

The conclusion of this analysis based on the data collected is that COVID has had a substantial impact on the housing market. An increase in the cost of building materials has contributed to a decrease in housing inventory across the nation. Due to housing inventory being unable to meet demand, we have seen a surge in average home values nationwide, or at least in every city included within this analysis.

Data was collected from Zillow for national and regional home values and inventory. Data was also collected from Macrotrends.net for historical prices for building materials.
